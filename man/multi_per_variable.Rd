\name{multi_per_variable}
\alias{multi_per_variable}
\title{Returns a table based on the information of a \code{multi_compare_object} that
indicates the proportion of biased variables. It can be outputted as HTML or
LaTex Table, for example with the help of the \link[stargazer]{stargazer}
function.}
\usage{
multi_per_variable(
  multi_compare_objects,
  type = "coefs",
  label_df = NULL,
  lables_coefs = NULL,
  lables_models = NULL,
  ndigits = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{multi_compare_objects}{A object returned by the
\code{\link[sampcompR]{multi_compare_object}} function. Object can either be
inserted as single object or as a character string containing the names of
multiple objects.}

\item{type}{The \code{type} of table, can either be \code{"coefs"},
\code{"models"}, or \code{"complete"}. When coefs is chosen, the average bias
of the coefficients is outputted, when models is chosen, the average bias
for the models is outputted, and when complete is chosen, both are outputted.}

\item{label_df}{A character vector containing labels for the data frames.}

\item{lables_coefs}{A character vector containing labels for the
coefficients.}

\item{lables_models}{A character vector containing labels for the
models.}

\item{ndigits}{Number of digits that is shown in the table.}
}
\value{
A matrix, that indicates the proportion of bias for every individual
coefficient or model for multivariate comparisons. This is given separately
for every comparison, as well as averaged over comparisons.
