# sampcompR (development version)

## Changes in version 0.3.1 (2025-13-03)
* Added two parameter to plot_uni_compare to adjust the size of the dots and the errorbars

## Changes in version 0.3.0 (2025-02-03)

* fix small bug in shapes of plot_uni_compare
* add a new function, to create a heatmap of relative bias for bivariate comparison
* add a new function, to show AAB or AARB in Pearson's r per variable as a table
* add a new function, to calculate missings per variable and display them in a table


## Changes in version 0.2.7 (2025-21-01)

* fixed a small error in biv_compare that occurred when sample size was very small and ended in an Error message.
* Added absolute relative bias to biv_compare output


## Changes in version 0.2.6 (2024-14-11)

* As the wooldridge package was archived on CRAN, and our examples rely on the card data of wooldridge, we added the card data to our package

## Changes in version 0.2.5 (2024-14-11)

* Added the possibility to input benchmarks as a named vector of means in univariate comparison
* Fixed small errors in the uni_compare_table functions that occurred when only one benchmark and survey were compared.
* Changed example to show bias comparison (estimating bias if only white respondents or if only north respondents would have been recruited)

## Changes in version 0.2.4 (2024-10-11)

* Added parameters that allow to bootstrap both benchmark and survey
* Added parameter to allow to choose between percentile or normal bootstrap confidence intervals and p-values based on those intervals.

## Changes in version 0.2.3 (2024-19-08)

* Additional small Fix for a test

## Changes in version 0.2.2 (2024-22-07)

* Small Fix for test on CRAN for MacOS

## Changes in version 0.2.1 (2024-14-07)

* We added biv_per_variable() a function to calculate the average bias per variable for the bivariate comparison,
  and an average bias per variable across comparisons.

* We added multi_per_variable() a function to calculate the average bias per coefficient and per model, 
  for the multivariate comparison, and an average biases per coefficient and per model across comparisons.


## Changes in version 0.2.0 (2024-08-07)

* We implemented better bootstrapping, that will use weighting in every bootstrap iteration, 
  for all main functions (\code{uni_compare}, \code{biv_compare}, \code{multi_compare}.

* The functions are much faster during bootstrapping now.

* The possibility to weight the dataset to the benchmark using \code{raking} and \code{post-stratification}.
